### Through restoring  the water flow where poeple have lost access to water through bad governance  and corruption 

#### In this project 
- I will use SQL to clean and explore data 60,000 unique records
- I will harness the power of SQL Functions, Including including intricate window functions, to draw insights from the data.
- Aggregate data to unravel the scale of the problem, and start to form some actionable insights.

## Data source
- The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an ongoing global call to action to end poverty, ensure prosperity and peace for all people, and protect our planet.

- There are 17 goals relating to poverty, health, education, basic services, inequality, climate, peace, and partnership.
    -    Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
- Due to changes in our climate, droughts are becoming more prevalent and water supplies are decreasing worldwide. This not only affects access to drinking water but also sanitation and hygiene which often results in unnecessary diseases and death.
##### datasource - WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (JMP)).

  ### Results and finding
Water Accessibility and Infrastructure Summary Report
This survey aimed to identify the water sources people use and determine both the total and average number of users for each source. Additionally, it examined the duration citizens typically spend in queues to access water.
### Insights
1. Most water sources are rural.
2. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean. These
 are mostly in Hawassa, Kilimani, and Akatsi.
3. 43% of our people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
4. 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes but within that group,
    45% face non-functional systems due to pipes, pumps, and reservoir issues.
5. 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs. Towns  like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, and a couple of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa  have broken infrastructure.
6. Citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes.
7. In terms of queues:
    - Queues are very long on Saturdays.
     - Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
    - Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues.

## Recommendations
1. Most people will benefit if we improve the shared taps first.
   - Wells are a good source of water, but many are contaminated. Fixing this will benefit a lot of people through installation of UV filters.
        - Fixing  existing infrastructure will help many people. If they have running water again,they dont have to queue, thereby shorting queue times for others. So, we can solve two problems at once.
        - Installing taps in homes will stretch our resources too thin, so for now, if the queue  times are low, we won&#39;t improve that source.
2. Most water sources are in rural areas. We need to ensure our teams know this as this  means they will have to make these repairs/upgrades in rural areas where road
    conditions, supplies, and labor are harder challenges to overcome.
